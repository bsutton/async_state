/// [DeferredState] makes it easy to do async initialisation

/// Instead of [StatefulWidget] deriving from [State] you derive
/// from [DeferredState].
///
/// You can then override the 'asyncInitState' method to do some
/// asynchrounus initialisation.
/// You then use [DeferredBuilder] to wait for the state
/// to be initialised.

///
/// Any items that are to be disposed should be called in the standard
/// [initState] as in some cases the [dispose] can be called before
/// [asyncInitState] has completed.
