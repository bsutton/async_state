# DeferredState

DeferredState Provides a simple way of doing asynchronous initialisation for a StatefulWidget.

> The StatefulWidget doesn't allow you to easily do async
initialisation in [initState], resulting in the need for convulated methods to initialise state.

DeferredState provides a reliable and simple method of overcoming this
problem by augmenting the [State] class with a [asyncInitState] method which 
behaves in a simiar manner to [initState] but allows async calls when
coupled with the [DefferedBuilder].

There are two classes in the async_state package [DeferredState] and [DeferredBuilder].  

To use [DeferredState] you derive your StatefulWidget's state from [DeferredState] instead of [State].


You then use [DeferredBuilder] in the State's [build] method so the builder
isn't called until the async initialisation is complete. (DeferredBuilder wraps a 
FutureBuilder under the hood).

Whilst the UI is waiting or if an error occurs, DeferredBuilder provides a default 
[waitingBuilder] and [errorBuilder] implementation but you can roll your own.

# Example
The easist way to understand DeferredState is by an example.

```dart
import 'package:deferred_state/deferred_state.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class SchedulePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<StatefulWidget> createState() => _SchedulPageState();
}

/// Derive from DeferredState rather than State
class _SchedulPageState extends DeferredState<SchedulePage> {
  /// requires async initialisation
  late final System system;
  /// requires sync initialisation so it can be disposed.
  late final TextEditingController _nameController;

  /// Items that are to be disposed must go in [initState]
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _nameController = TextEditingController();
  }

  /// Items that need to be initialised asychronously 
  /// go here. Make certain to [await] them, use 
  /// a [completer] if necessary.
  @override
  Future<void> asyncInitState() async {
    system = await DaoSystem().get();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _nameController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    /// Waits for [asyncInitState] to complete and then calls
    /// the builder.
    return DeferredBuilder(this, builder: (context) => Text(system.name));
  }
}

class System {
  System(this.name);
  String name;
}

class DaoSystem {
  Future<System> get() async {
    /// get the system record from the db.
    return System('example');
  }
}

```

# customising the waiting and error UI
The [DeferredBuilder] includes [waitingBuilder] and  [errorBuilder] arguments 
to allow you to customise the UI during these phases but provides default 
builders for both.

If you don't like the default [waitingBuilder] and [errorBuilder] you can create you own version of DeferredBuilder with
your own custom builders so you don't have to specify the 
[waitingBuilder] and [errorBuilder] at every call 
site.

The example includes [waitingBuilder] or [errorBuilder] as optional arguments 
to your  [MyDeferredBuilder]. 
This isn't necessary unless you have call sites that need additional 
customisation (you may be better off creating multiple versions of [MyDeferredBuilder]).  If you don't need this level of customisation then
 just delete the [waitingBuilder] and [errorBuilder] args
that are passed to [MyDeferredBuilder].

```dart
/// Create your on [DeferredBuilder] to customise the
/// error and waiting builders without having to
/// specify them at every call site.
class MyDeferredBuilder extends StatelessWidget {
  MyDeferredBuilder(this.state,
      {required this.builder, this.waitingBuilder, this.errorBuilder});
  final DeferredState state;
  final WidgetBuilder builder;

  /// Include the waiting and error builders as arguments to
  /// [MyDeferredBuilder] if you might want to do further customisation at some
  /// call sites, otherwise delete these fields.
  final WaitingBuilder? waitingBuilder;
  final ErrorBuilder? errorBuilder;

  Widget build(BuildContext context) => DeferredBuilder(state,
      /// Customise the waiting message here
      waitingBuilder: (c => Center(child: Text('waiting')), here
      /// Customise the error message here.
      errorBuilder: (context, error) => Center(child: Text(error.toString())),
      builder: (context) => builder(context));
}
```
